Extras Guide:

This set of .cfg files allows you to make Karborundum procurement a bit easier.  Each of the first three files will create Karborundum as a resource on the planet named in the filename - Tylo, Dres and Ike, respectively.  

If you just want to play around and don't really want to get into the logistics, I've also added a fourth file that just makes Karborundum tweakable in the VAB - although, importantly, it is not free.  

To use any of these, simply drag them into your gamedata folder.  You may want to put them in the ESLD Beacons folder for organizational purposes.
