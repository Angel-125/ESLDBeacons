description = Essentially just a LB-100 fused to a spaceship, this beacon has been specially modified to allow self-transport.  This makes opening the initial space-time tear very inefficient, but gives extraordinary fuel economy for high-weight, long-distance transfers.  Although the IB-1 can serve as a target for transfers, interference from the modifications means that beam spread is increased.  Free Heisenkerb Compensator with every purchase, while supplies last.
